### Additional Optional Features:

| Feature | Applicable to | Cost (Monthly) | 6 Instances Cost |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Geo-Replication | E5, E10 | ~25% of base cache | ~$1,026 (E5) / ~$2,052 (E10) |
| Redis Modules (Bloom, Search, etc.) | E5, E10 | ~$171/instance | ~$1,026 |
| Customer Managed Keys | E5, E10 | ~$85/instance | ~$510 |
| Enhanced Support | E5, E10 | 10-25% of spend | Variable |

### Important Notes:
1. **Pricing**: Based on US East list prices (actual costs vary by region and currency)
2. **Reserved Capacity**: 1-year commitment reduces costs by ~20%, 3-year by ~40%
3. **Enterprise Flash**: Available only on E100 and higher tiers
4. **Throughput**: E5 supports ~12K ops/sec, E10 ~30K ops/sec per instance
5. **HA Default**: All enterprise tiers include automatic zone-redundant deployment

Would you like me to:
1. Provide a comparison with Standard/Premium tiers?
2. Include typical networking costs?
3. Create a 3-year TCO projection with reserved instances?
4. Suggest optimal instance distribution based on workload patterns?
